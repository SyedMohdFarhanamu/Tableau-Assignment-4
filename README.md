# Tableau-Assignment-4
* Here we'll work with the Ecommerece Customers csv file from the company. Which has customer info such as Email, Address, and their Avatar color and other numeric value  columns:

   -  Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions
   -  Time on App: Average time spent on App in munites
   -  Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
   -  Length of Membership: for how long the person has been associated with the company as a customer
   
 The project looks at financial planning issue an E-Commerce firm is facing-should the firm focus on its mobile app or website ?

For this, I thought the most feasible way for the firm to approach this would be by focusing on the service that customers spend most time on, regardless of whether or not they make purhcases. So, in this project I attempt at creating a quantifiable relationship between the the time spent on App or Website vs Length of the Membership.
